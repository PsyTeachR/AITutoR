The philosophy of this book is firmly rooted in the cognitive science of learning and as such, retrieval practice, distributed practice, and elaboration will all play a key role.\nIt is perhaps easier to start by explaining what this book is not:\n\nThis book is not a stand-alone resource. It is intended to be used alongside other course materials. To make the most out of this book, you will need things like Intended Learning Outcomes or key terms.\nThis book will not encourage learners to take short-cuts. That students should be able to understanding the principles of what they are learning and to critically evaluate writing on the topic, regardless of who or what wrote it, is non-negotiable.\nFor the coding aspects of this book, we will not not teach you how to use platforms like Github Copilot and it is not aimed at proficient or advanced programmers.\n\nInstead, this book will aim to help learners use AI platforms as a personalised tutor. By the end of this book, learners should be able to:\n\nUse AI to explain concepts and functions in a level of detail and technicality appropriate to the knowledge and skill of the learner\nUse AI to generate practice questions to test understanding\nUse AI to create study plans\nUse AI to debug errors in code\nUse AI to review, comments, and refactor code\nUse AI to responsibly assist with writing code\nCritically evaluate and appraise the output of AI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nThis book was written in Spring 2024 and should be considered a living document.

    "text": "1.1.1 AI model vs AI platforms\nThere are more qualified people who can explain AI better than I can but a brief but important distinction is between the AI model and the AI platform. The underlying AI model is a Large Language Model (LLM) that essentially does extremely sophisticated predictive text - it’s not thinking, it’s not conscious, it just is very good at deciding what word is likely to come after another word in a way that is human-like1.\nDifferent software companies have created different AI models. Google’s latest model is named Gemini. OpenAI has a series of models it refers to as Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT). The explosion in AI in terms of public awareness came about when OpenAI released GPT version 3. Since then they’ve released 3.5, 4, and the most recent version is 4o. The capability of each successive AI is claimed to increase significantly, both in terms of its ability (e.g., to pass standardised tests) and in the human-ness of its responses.\nIn some cases, the name of the model and the name of the platform you use are the same. So Google’s model is named Gemini and that’s the name of the platform. On the other hand, ChatGPT is the name of the platform, but the underlying model it uses is GPT4o. Additionally, other companies and apps can licence use of the models so Microsoft’s Copilot uses GPT4.\nIt isn’t necessary that you understand all of this in detail. The key thing is that the underlying model is the same for some platforms (so you should expect similar capabilities) and that this model can and will update.\n\n1.1.2 Ethics and AI\nIt’s beyond the scope of this book (and my expertise) to go into much detail about the ethics of AI but I want to acknowledge that in several ways, they’re hugely problematic.\nFirst, and most importantly, AIs are trained on huge corpora of human language. Humans are full of bias and prejudice and consequently, so are our offspring AIs who have been repeatedly found to encode sexist, racist, and abelist views in their outputs.\n\nTeaching AI Ethics: Bias and Discrimination\n\nSecond, many of the developers that have produced AI models have done so behind closed doors and are very secretive about exactly what data the models have been trained on. One of the reasons for this is because it is very clearly apparent that many AI models have been given access to copyrighted sources (e.g., books and film scripts) and there are an increasing number of lawsuits being filed although it remains unclear what the future holds given how far and how fast the horse has already bolted.\n\nGenerative AI Has an Intellectual Property Problem\n\nThird, whilst the use of AI has been touted as a solution to help us manage climate change, it’s also a direct contributor to the problem because of the energy demands.\n\nAs Use of A.I. Soars, So Does the Energy and Water It Requires",

    "text": "1.2 AI platforms\n\n1.2.1 ChatGPT\nYou can sign-up for ChatGPT at https://chat.openai.com/. The free version uses 4o although there are limits on how many messagfes you can send in a certain time period and it is sometimes unavailable. When this happens, it will revert to 3.5. The free version is very fast and for beginner level courses does perform quite well. I’ve also found that ChatGPT is good at understanding the intent of what I want. ChatGPT also makes it easy to save your chat history so that you can continue working in previous chats at a later date. A useful feature is the “regenerate” function whereby if you’re not completely happy with the response, you can quickly ask it to generate another attempt and compare them. ChatGPT has a mobile app and allows you to share links to saved chats.\nThe disadvantages of ChatGPT are that it has limited internet connectivity and the information in its database will be restricted. At the time of writing this book, ChatGPT’s training data extends until January 2022, so it can’t tell you about anything that happened after that point (regardless of whether that’s world event or a new R function). Whilst it does depend on which version you’re using, it rarely gives you links to sources for where it has found the information.\n\n\n\n\nusing ChatGPT\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Copilot\nMicrosoft Copilot can be accessed at https://copilot.microsoft.com/ and you can sign-in with your Microsoft Account. If you are a University of Glasgow student (and also at many other universities), you can access Copilot through your university account and your Office365 subscription. If you do so, you’ll be able to access the Enterprise version of Copilot. The advantage of using your Enterprise account is that the data is processed more securely and what you input won’t be used to train the model. The price you pay for this security - and it’s such a big price that I don’t use it much for this reason - is that it doesn’t save your chat history so you start each time afresh. If you use a personal account, it will save your chat history, but also use your data to train the model.\nHowever, where Copilot shines is that it has access to the internet and will give you links to where it got its information so it’s easier to verify the output than ChatGPT. Additionally, they don’t make this clear but if you select the conversation style to be “Creative”, it will use GPT4.0.\nI have found that Copilot more frequently doesn’t understand the intent of what I am asking and with the same prompt as ChatGPT will give me a useless answer, but let’s see how I feel about that by the end of writing this book.\nMy general approach is that if I want to be able to return to my conversation, I use ChatGPT or Gemini. If I want links to sources, I use Copilot.\n\n\n\n\nusing ChatGPT\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Gemini\nYou can access Gemini at https://gemini.google.com/ and sign-in with a regular Google account. Gemini was previously known as Bard.\nGemini also makes it easy to save and share your chat history and you can export it easily to Google Docs. Gemini’s strength lies in its connectivity to the internet. Like Copilot, it will provide links as part of its response (although sometimes they don’t always work) and you can also ask it to try and verify its response through using a regular Google search.\nAdditionally, Gemini has a “modify response” option where you can quickly ask it to make the response shorter, longer, simpler, more causal, or more professional.\nAnother advantage is that it uses a different model to ChatGPT so if you’re going to combine different AIs, using Gemini may give a different response.\nThere is a Gemini mobile app, but it isn’t currently available in the UK.\nBefore writing this book, I had used Gemini less than the others. Let’s see where I end up at the end.\n\n\n\n\nusing ChatGPT",

    "text": "1.4 Activity 2\nThe key difference between using an AI and a regular search engine is that you can shape the output of the AI by “prompt engineering”, which is the phrase used to describe the art of asking the question in a way that gives you the answer you want. It’s easier to show than tell.\nThink of a book, TV show, film, or video game that you know really well. I chose Final Fantasy VII (the original PlayStation version). Ask the AI to give you three different summaries and try out the functionality of each platform. For example, for ChatGPT ask it to regenerate the response, for Gemini, use modify response or Double-check response with Google.\n\nFirst, ask it for a summary without any additional context e.g., “Give me a summary of Final Fantasy VII (original playstation version)”\nThen, ask it for a summary but give it a steer on the intended audience, e.g., “Give me a summary of Final Fantasy VII (original playstation version) for someone who knows nothing about videogames” or “Give me a summary of Final Fantasy VII (original playstation version) for an expert gamer who has played it many times”\nFinally, ask it for a summary, but give it a steer on how it should act, e.g., “Act as an expert videogame reviewer for the Guardian. Give me a summary of Final Fantasy VII (original playstation version) for an expert gamer who has played it many times” or “Act as someone who spends too much time on Reddit and thinks they know everything. Give me a summary of Final Fantasy VII (original playstation version) for an expert gamer who has played it many times”.\n\nThe key takeaways to remember for your learning journey are:\n\nTell it how to act\nTell it who you are\n\nReflect on the differences between the summaries - the technicality of the language, the accuracy and nuance of the information, what it chose to focus on, and what it chose to omit. The reason I asked you to create a summary of something you already know well is that you’re aware of where the gaps are. Remember this when you’re asking an AI something you don’t know as well. Just because you can’t see the gaps, inaccuracies, and biases, doesn’t mean they’re not there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nThis book was written in Spring 2024 and should be considered a living document.

    "text": "3.6 Cautions and caveats\nThe questions it generates are generally helpful, but not always. Here’s the issues we’ve come across whilst writing this book that we have not been able to prevent entirely by tweaking the prompts.\n\n3.6.1 Mulitple-choice / TOF / SAQ questions\n\nSometimes it is just plain wrong. The answer here should be C. If you tell it that it is wrong, it can correct itself (but also if you tell it that it is wrong even when it is right, it sometimes accepts that it is wrong). Bear this in mind if you ever use it to produce anything that AI does not have any knowledge, it’s just a very sophisticated parrot. \nIt may ask you questions about functions or concepts you’ve haven’t covered in the course.\nIt may give you a question where there are multiple correct answers without indicating this is the case, which can be confusing.\nIt may focus too much on certain topics of functions and you have to ask it to give you questions on a topic/function specifically.\n\n3.6.2 Coding problems\n\nIt suggests using a built-in dataset that doesn’t exist. In this case, tell it that’s the case and it will suggest a different dataset for the problem.\nThe example it gives isn’t fully reproducible so you have to write the code without being able to run it in R. For example, it assumes you have a dataset with columns named “number” and “price”, but loads no such dataset, so you can’t actually try out the code. It’s still possible to write the code, but without being able to run it, much more difficult, particularly as a beginner.\n\n3.6.3 Error mode\n\nThis is the category the AI struggled with the most, to the point where at the time of writing, we can’t say that it’s up to the task. We have tried writing the prompts multiple times and whilst we have seen some improvement, it’s not consistent. We have a premium ChatGPT subscription and also tried using GPT4.0 and it didn’t help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nUpdate! OpenAI released GPT4o in May 2024 and this can produce sensible error mode problems. We’ve left the below in this book because at the time of writing, Copilot, Gemini, and earlier versions of GPT can’t and it’s an interesting insight into some of the issues with AI.\n\n\n\nFrom a learning and teaching perspective, it’s a good example of why teaching might actually be a skill and our job might be safe after all. When we use Error Mode type questions in our courses, we design the errors so that they’re common mistakes learners make at that point in their journey, they’re mistakes that learners would plausibly make, and solving them will teach you something of use. Even when the AI managed to create an accurate error mode problem, it still wasn’t helpful for learning.\nIn our initial attempts at prompting, Gemini did poorly at this. It gave us code that did not have errors, or it would tell us what the errors were, or it would give errors that were so obvious they wouldn’t help you learn at all. For example:\n\n - We then updated the prompt to say that the errors should be plausible and not to tell us what the errors were. This helped but only sometimes. - ChatGPT fared slightly better although all of the problems were very basic and of the same type (creating a vector) until we asked it to give us a specific problem (e.g., error mode for ggplot). - ChatGPT also suffered from the same problems as Gemini in that it would tell you what the error was or produce code that did not have any errors. We particularly enjoyed this response whereby it seemed to pretend that it was doing it on purpose as a teachable moment. We know we are anthropomorphising the AI here but we imagine any educator will feel a sense of kinship at trying to make your mistakes seem intentional.\n\n\nIt often won’t tell you what built-in dataset you need to load to run the code (and this isn’t the intended error). Unless you have a working knowledge of built-in datasets in R and the packages they’re from, this is unnecessarily confusing.\nThere is no prompt we could give Copilot that will result in it producing code with an error (even when the same prompt works with ChatGPT). So we gave up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nThis book was written in Spring 2024 and should be considered a living document.

However, that means that you are giving it at least some of the raw data so you have to be very careful if you have sensitive / confidential data and you must ensure that any use of AI is in line with your data management plan. Using Copilot Enterprise means the data won’t be stored and used to train the AI further so it’s potentially the best option (which is not to say it’s safe or problem free, please be careful and critical!).\n\nstr(penguins)\n\ntibble [344 × 8] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ species          : Factor w/ 3 levels \"Adelie\",\"Chinstrap\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ island           : Factor w/ 3 levels \"Biscoe\",\"Dream\",..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...\n $ bill_length_mm   : num [1:344] 39.1 39.5 40.3 NA 36.7 39.3 38.9 39.2 34.1 42 ...\n $ bill_depth_mm    : num [1:344] 18.7 17.4 18 NA 19.3 20.6 17.8 19.6 18.1 20.2 ...\n $ flipper_length_mm: int [1:344] 181 186 195 NA 193 190 181 195 193 190 ...\n $ body_mass_g      : int [1:344] 3750 3800 3250 NA 3450 3650 3625 4675 3475 4250 ...\n $ sex              : Factor w/ 2 levels \"female\",\"male\": 2 1 1 NA 1 2 1 2 NA NA ...\n $ year             : int [1:344] 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 ...\n\n\nFinally, ls() provides a list of all the variables in a given object. It doesn’t provide any info on the variable type or sample, but that does mean it’s the most secure and depending on the task, this might be all the info you really need to give the AI. I would suggest starting with ls() and only scaling up if necessary (and your data isn’t sensitive):\n\nls(penguins)\n\n[1] \"bill_depth_mm\"     \"bill_length_mm\"    \"body_mass_g\"      \n[4] \"flipper_length_mm\" \"island\"            \"sex\"              \n[7] \"species\"           \"year\"             \n\n\n\nRun summary(biscoe_penguins) and give the AI the output so that it better understands the structure and contents of the datasets\n\nIf you haven’t spotted it by now, the error is that in the filter biscoe should be Biscoe with a capital B. It still doesn’t have the information it needs to tell you this explicitly, but it will get you very close. There is no shortcut for knowing your data.\n\n\n\n\nCopilot getting very close",

    "text": "6.4 Activity 3: Review existing comments\nIn addition to asking AI to comment your code, you can also ask it to review comments you’ve made yourself. To see how this works with a more complex example, and as an act of masochism, I gave the AI some code I wrote for a publication. The full paper is here if you’re interested - the quant analyses ended up being punted to the online appendix because of word count.\nYou can load in the dataset yourself with this code:\n\n# read in data but skip rows 2 and 3\ncol_names &lt;- names(read_csv(\"https://osf.io/download/tf3xs/\", n_max = 0))\ndat_raw &lt;- read_csv(\"https://osf.io/download/tf3xs/\", col_names = col_names, skip = 3) \n\nThe first section of my code involved quite a complicated and long bit of wrangling, all done in a single pipeline. The purpose of the code is to clean up data collected on the survey platform Qualtrics and recoding some of the demographic variables. This is actually a shortened version because the original hit the character limit for Copilot. I did put some effort into writing comments before publication but there are almost certainly improvements to be made.\n\ndat &lt;- dat_raw%&gt;%\n  filter(Progress &gt; 94, # remove incomplete responses\n         DistributionChannel != \"preview\") %&gt;% # Remove Emily's preview data\n  select(ResponseId, \"duration\" = 5, Q5:Q21) %&gt;%\n  # replace NAs with \"none\" for disability info\n  mutate(disability_nos = replace_na(disability_nos, \"None\"),\n         physical_chronic = replace_na(physical_chronic, \"None\"),\n         mental_health = replace_na(mental_health, \"None\"),\n) %&gt;%\n   # recode gender data\n\n  mutate(gender_cleaned = case_when(Q6 %in% c(\"Female\", \"female\", \"Woman\", \"woman\", \"Cisgender woman\",\"female (she/her)\", \"F\", \"f\", \"Womxn\", \"Woman (tranas)\") ~ \"Woman\",\n                                    Q6 %in% c(\"Man\", \"man\", \"M\", \"m\", \"Male (he/him)\", \"Male\", \"male\", \"Trans man.\") ~ \"Man\",\n                                    Q6 %in% c(\"Agender\", \"Genderfluid\", \"GNC\", \"NB\", \"non-binary\", \"    \nNon-binary\", \"Non-Binary\", \"Non-binary femme\", \"non-binary male\", \"non binary\",\n\"Non binary\", \"Nonbinary\", \"Queer\", \"Transmasculine\", \"Non-binary\") ~ \"Non-binary\",\n                            TRUE ~ \"Not stated\")) %&gt;%\n  # select necessary columns and tidy up the names\n        select(ResponseId,\n             \"age\" = Q5,\n             \"gender\" = Q6,\n             \"mature\" = Q7,\n             \"level_study\" = Q8,\n             \"country\" = Q9,\n             \"subject\" = Q10,\n             \"english_first\" = Q11,\n             \"neurotype_open\" = Q13, \n             \"disability_open\" = Q14,\n             \"why_open\" = Q18,\n             \"how_open\" = Q23,\n             \"advantages\" = Q20,\n             \"disadvantages\" = Q21,\n             everything()) \n\nMy initial attempt at this used the following prompt:\n\nReview my use of comments and make improvements to the comments where necessary. Explain what you changed and why.\n\nIt’s reviewed the comments and they’re not bad edits but extremely problematically, it didn’t just change the comments, it changed the code. The original first use of select() was select(ResponseId, \"duration\" = 5, Q5:Q21) %&gt;%. In this code, I selected the columns I wanted but I also renamed the 5th column. Gemini has removed this line of code it doesn’t tell me anywhere that it made this change. It’s also removed the final call to select() which I used to rearrange the columns, it’s changed some of the variable names, and it’s changed “None” to “Not disclosed”. This code no longer runs. Be very, very careful.\n\n# Filter out incomplete responses and exclude preview data\ndat_gemini &lt;- dat_raw %&gt;%\n  filter(Progress &gt; 94, DistributionChannel != \"preview\") %&gt;%\n\n  # Select relevant columns and rename for clarity\n  select(ResponseId,\n         age = Q5,\n         gender = Q6,\n         mature = Q7,\n         level_of_study = Q8,\n         country = Q9,\n         subject = Q10,\n         english_as_first_language = Q11,\n         neurotypical = replace_na(Q13, \"Not disclosed\"),  # Replace NA with informative value\n         disability = replace_na(Q14, \"Not disclosed\"),  # Replace NA with informative value\n         why_participate = Q18,\n         how_participate = Q23,\n         participation_advantages = Q20,\n         participation_disadvantages = Q21) %&gt;%\n\n  # Recode gender data into standardized categories\n  mutate(gender_cleaned = case_when(\n    Q6 %in% c(\"Female\", \"female\", \"Woman\", \"woman\", \"Cisgender woman\", \"female (she/her)\", \"F\", \"f\", \"Womxn\", \"Woman (trans)\") ~ \"Woman\",\n    Q6 %in% c(\"Man\", \"man\", \"M\", \"m\", \"Male (he/him)\", \"Male\", \"male\", \"Trans man.\") ~ \"Man\",\n    Q6 %in% c(\"Agender\", \"Genderfluid\", \"GNC\", \"NB\", \"non-binary\", \"    Non-binary\", \"Non-Binary\", \"Non-binary femme\", \"non-binary male\", \"non binary\", \"Non binary\", \"Nonbinary\", \"Queer\", \"Transmasculine\", \"Non-binary\") ~ \"Non-binary\",\n    TRUE ~ \"Not stated\"\n  ))\n\n# This line (select(everything())) is unnecessary after renaming columns\n\n\nExplanation of Changes: Comments: Added comments explaining the purpose of each dplyr verb (filter, select, mutate). Clarified the purpose of filtering out responses and preview data. Explained the renaming of columns for better readability. Instead of “replace NAs with none”, used more informative text like “Not disclosed” for disability and neurotype information. Code: Removed the unnecessary select(everything()) line at the end. This line would have selected all columns again after renaming them, making it redundant. These changes improve the clarity and maintainability of the code. The comments explain the “why” behind each step, while the code itself is more concise and efficient.\n\n\n6.4.1 More prompt engineering\nAgain I played about with the prompt to try and prevent these issues:\n\nReview my use of comments and make improvements to the comments where necessary. Keep the comments as concise as possible. Do not change anything about the code.\n\nCopilot and ChatGPT did much better with this. To check that the object it created hadn’t changed any of the code, I ran all.equal(dat, dat_copilot) which returns true. This is a really important check.\n\n# Assigning the processed data to 'dat'\ndat_copilot &lt;- dat_raw %&gt;%\n  filter(Progress &gt; 94, # Exclude responses below 95% completion\n       DistributionChannel != \"preview\") %&gt;% # Exclude preview data\nselect(ResponseId, \"duration\" = 5, Q5:Q21) %&gt;%\nmutate(\n  disability_nos = replace_na(disability_nos, \"None\"), # Default 'None' for missing disability info\n  physical_chronic = replace_na(physical_chronic, \"None\"),\n  mental_health = replace_na(mental_health, \"None\")\n) %&gt;%\nmutate(\n  gender_cleaned = case_when(\n    Q6 %in% c(\"Female\", \"female\", \"Woman\", \"woman\", \"Cisgender woman\",\"female (she/her)\", \"F\", \"f\", \"Womxn\", \"Woman (tranas)\") ~ \"Woman\",\n    Q6 %in% c(\"Man\", \"man\", \"M\", \"m\", \"Male (he/him)\", \"Male\", \"male\", \"Trans man.\") ~ \"Man\",\n    Q6 %in% c(\"Agender\", \"Genderfluid\", \"GNC\", \"NB\", \"non-binary\", \"Non-binary\", \"Non-Binary\", \"Non-binary femme\", \"non-binary male\", \"non binary\", \"Non binary\", \"Nonbinary\", \"Queer\", \"Transmasculine\", \"Non-binary\") ~ \"Non-binary\",\n    TRUE ~ \"Not stated\"\n  ) # Standardize gender representation\n) %&gt;%\nselect(\n  ResponseId,\n  \"age\" = Q5, # Rename Q5 to 'age'\n  \"gender\" = Q6, # Rename Q6 to 'gender'\n  \"mature\" = Q7, # Rename Q7 to 'mature'\n  \"level_study\" = Q8, # Rename Q8 to 'level_study'\n  \"country\" = Q9, # Rename Q9 to 'country'\n  \"subject\" = Q10, # Rename Q10 to 'subject'\n  \"english_first\" = Q11, # Rename Q11 to 'english_first'\n  \"neurotype_open\" = Q13, # Rename Q13 to 'neurotype_open'\n  \"disability_open\" = Q14, # Rename Q14 to 'disability_open'\n  \"why_open\" = Q18, # Rename Q18 to 'why_open'\n  \"how_open\" = Q23, # Rename Q23 to 'how_open'\n  \"advantages\" = Q20, # Rename Q20 to 'advantages'\n  \"disadvantages\" = Q21, # Rename Q21 to 'disadvantages'\n  everything() # Include all remaining columns\n)\n\nGemini’s answer doesn’t include the full code, so it’s extremely unhelpful as you can’t copy and paste it back in to your script:\n\ndat_gemini &lt;- dat_raw %&gt;%\n\n  filter(Progress &gt; 94, # Min. 95% completion)  # Shorten completion threshold text\n  DistributionChannel != \"preview\") %&gt;%  # Exclude previews\n\nselect(ResponseId, duration = 5, Q5:Q21) %&gt;%  # Set duration & select cols\n\nmutate(disability_nos = replace_na(disability_nos, \"None\"),  # Impute disability data\n       physical_chronic = replace_na(physical_chronic, \"None\"),\n       mental_health = replace_na(mental_health, \"None\")) %&gt;%\n\nmutate(gender_cleaned = case_when(  # Standardize gender\n  Q6 %in% c(...) ~ \"Woman\",  # ...

The goal is to make the code more maintainable, readable, and efficient, while not altering the functionality or output. The benefits of refactoring code should be that it:\n\nImproves Readability: Makes the code easier to understand for anyone who reads it in the future, which includes other developers or even the original author after some time has passed.\nReduces Complexity: Simplifies complex code structures, breaking down large functions into smaller, more manageable ones.\nEnhances Maintainability: With cleaner code, it becomes easier to maintain and update the software over time.\nFacilitates Extensibility: Well-factored code can be extended with new features more easily.\nImproves Performance: In some cases, refactoring can optimize the performance of the software by removing redundancies and improving algorithms.\nIdentifies Bugs: The process of refactoring can often reveal hidden bugs or issues in the code that can then be fixed.\n\nWith thanks to Copilot for writing the above.",

    "text": "6.8 Conclusions\nI hadn’t actually used AI to perform these types of tasks before writing this book so here’s my takeaways:\n\nCHECK EVERYTHING.\nIf you give an AI code, you simply cannot trust that it won’t change your code, even if that’s not the task you ask it to do. If you use AI to add or review comments, you must check the output. Tools like all.equal() can help perform these checks.\nYou also can’t trust that the comments will be accurate. Anything an AI writes must be checked before you use it. If you don’t know if it’s right, don’t use it.\nBecause you have to check what it does so carefully, don’t give it a big dump of code. Smaller chunks will end up taking less time.\nIn some cases it was really useful and as someone who doesn’t really use or know much Base R, I can see that this would be a great way to learn alternative approaches or to fill in comments.\nThat said, the amount of checking it takes is substantial and so I’m not completely convinced that it would be any quicker than doing it yourself.\nThey all struggled at different points although I think Of the three, Gemini was the clear loser of this chapter, which is a shame as I was starting to like it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nThis book was written in Spring 2024 and should be considered a living document. The functionality and capability of AI is changing rapidly and the most recent advances may not reflect what is described in this book. Given the brave new world in which we now live, all constructive feedback and suggestions are welcome! If you have any feedback or suggestions, please provide it via Forms.",

You could write out a description manually but there’s a few options to automate.\nsummary() is useful because it provides a list of all variables with some descriptive statistics so that the AI has a sense of the type and range of data:\n\nsummary(penguins)\n\n      species          island    bill_length_mm  bill_depth_mm  \n Adelie   :152   Biscoe   :168   Min.   :32.10   Min.   :13.10  \n Chinstrap: 68   Dream    :124   1st Qu.:39.23   1st Qu.:15.60  \n Gentoo   :124   Torgersen: 52   Median :44.45   Median :17.30  \n                                 Mean   :43.92   Mean   :17.15  \n                                 3rd Qu.:48.50   3rd Qu.:18.70  \n                                 Max.   :59.60   Max.   :21.50  \n                                 NA's   :2       NA's   :2      \n flipper_length_mm  body_mass_g       sex           year     \n Min.   :172.0     Min.   :2700   female:165   Min.   :2007  \n 1st Qu.:190.0     1st Qu.:3550   male  :168   1st Qu.:2007  \n Median :197.0     Median :4050   NA's  : 11   Median :2008  \n Mean   :200.9     Mean   :4202                Mean   :2008  \n 3rd Qu.:213.0     3rd Qu.:4750                3rd Qu.:2009  \n Max.   :231.0     Max.   :6300                Max.   :2009  \n NA's   :2         NA's   :2                                 \n\n\nstr() is also useful because it lists the variables, their data type, and the initial values for each variable. However, that means that you are giving it at least some of the raw data so you have to be very careful if you have sensitive / confidential data and you must ensure that any use of AI is in line with your data management plan. Using Copilot Enterprise means the data won’t be stored and used to train the AI further so it’s potentially the best option (which is not to say it’s safe or problem free, please be careful and critical!).\n\nstr(penguins)\n\ntibble [344 × 8] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ species          : Factor w/ 3 levels \"Adelie\",\"Chinstrap\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ island           : Factor w/ 3 levels \"Biscoe\",\"Dream\",..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...\n $ bill_length_mm   : num [1:344] 39.1 39.5 40.3 NA 36.7 39.3 38.9 39.2 34.1 42 ...\n $ bill_depth_mm    : num [1:344] 18.7 17.4 18 NA 19.3 20.6 17.8 19.6 18.1 20.2 ...\n $ flipper_length_mm: int [1:344] 181 186 195 NA 193 190 181 195 193 190 ...\n $ body_mass_g      : int [1:344] 3750 3800 3250 NA 3450 3650 3625 4675 3475 4250 ...\n $ sex              : Factor w/ 2 levels \"female\",\"male\": 2 1 1 NA 1 2 1 2 NA NA ...\n $ year             : int [1:344] 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 ...\n\n\nFinally, ls() provides a list of all the variables in a given object. It doesn’t provide any info on the variable type or sample, but that does mean it’s the most secure and depending on the task, this might be all the info you really need to give the AI. I would suggest starting with ls() and only scaling up if necessary (and your data isn’t sensitive):\n\nls(penguins)\n\n[1] \"bill_depth_mm\"     \"bill_length_mm\"    \"body_mass_g\"      \n[4] \"flipper_length_mm\" \"island\"            \"sex\"              \n[7] \"species\"           \"year\"             \n\n\nIn your AI of choice, input the following:\n\nhere are the variables in my data set\n\n\nls(penguins) [1] “bill_depth_mm” “bill_length_mm” “body_mass_g” “flipper_length_mm” [5] “island” “sex” “species” “year”\n\nWithout being asked, Copilot has provided some examples of how you might analyse this data using R and the code all works as intended.\n\n# Load the tidyverse package\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Assuming your data is in a dataframe called 'penguins'\n# Let's start by getting a summary of each numerical variable\npenguins %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    Average_Bill_Depth = mean(bill_depth_mm, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Average_Bill_Length = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Average_Body_Mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Average_Flipper_Length = mean(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage_Bill_Depth\nAverage_Bill_Length\nAverage_Body_Mass\nAverage_Flipper_Length\n\n\n17.15117\n43.92193\n4201.754\n200.9152\n\n\n\n\n# Now, let's see the distribution of species across different islands\npenguins %&gt;%\n  count(island, species) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = island, y = n, fill = species)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Penguin Species Across Islands\",\n       x = \"Island\",\n       y = \"Count\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# We can also explore the relationship between flipper length and body mass\npenguins %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = species)) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n  labs(title = \"Relationship Between Flipper Length and Body Mass\",\n       x = \"Flipper Length (mm)\",\n       y = \"Body Mass (g)\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_smooth()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# If you want to perform more specific analyses or visualizations,\n# please let me know what you're interested in!\n\nI find this hugely problematic. Psychology has spent the last decade dealing with a replication and reproducibility crisis stemming in part because of questionable research practices. As a researcher, you should be making informed decisions as to how you analyse your data and I fear that this type of output is going to increase phishing and atheoretical, exploratory-as-confirmatory nonsense. What happens when the example code the AI spits out without being asked turns out to be a significant regression model that you would never have predicted or run yourself? Are you going to delete it? Or convince yourself that you were going to run it anyway and there’s a perfectly logical explanation?\nBefore I have a full blown existential crisis, let’s get back on track.",

This is a very common choice but remember it is a choice. You might not want this.\nSimilarly, it’s specified binwidth = 20 for the histogram. Looking at the data this seems like a reasonable binwidth to use, but again, it is a decision the AI has imposed and you must be aware of what you’re accepting.\nI am aware that I am using phrases like “choice” and “decision” that imbue the AI with consciousness. I know that’s not true, I just can’t figure out how to write it any other way.\n\nChatGPT and Copilot both worked well. Gemini on the other hand… had a bit of a moment. First, it told me that it couldn’t complete the request so I amended the variable name, thinking that perhaps it needed the exact name. It then produced a table rather than giving me the code. The numbers in this table look like plausible values for this dataset (although don’t match exactly) so I suspect it has information about the palmerpenguins dataset.\n\n\n\n\nGemini missing the mark\n\n\n\nThe issue is that I didn’t tell it to write me code -I told it to create a table which is did, although it’s interesting that both Copilot and ChatGPT understood the intent of my prompt and Gemini did not.\nI then edited my prompt:\n\nWrite code to create a table of descriptive statistics for body_mass_g and a histogram of that variable\n\nAnd it responded by giving me python code. Again, not technically wrong given the prompt but it does mean that it is ignoring the rest of the conversation and the initial set-up prompt. Following up to ask specifically for R code worked, but it’s not a good start for Gemini.\n\n\n\n\nGemini going rogue",

    "section": "\n7.4 Activity 4: Giving the AI more freedom",
    "text": "7.4 Activity 4: Giving the AI more freedom\nMy initial request to write code was relatively simple and relatively well-specified but let’s try an example where there’s more room for the AI to make choices.\n\nCreate a new variable that codes each penguin as chonky_boi if they’re a large male, chonky_gurl if they’re a large female, smol_boi if they’re a small male, and smol_boi if they’re a small female.\n\nThis prompt gives a lot of leeway. I haven’t specified what to call the new variable, what criteria should be used to determine large and small, or what to do with observations that are neither.\nChatGPT used percentiles to determine category, however, this code didn’t work - it returns all observations as “average”:\n\n# Create a new variable based on conditions\npenguins &lt;- penguins %&gt;%\n  mutate(chonkiness = case_when(\n    sex == \"Male\" & body_mass_g &gt; quantile(body_mass_g, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE) ~ \"chonky_boi\",\n    sex == \"Female\" & body_mass_g &gt; quantile(body_mass_g, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE) ~ \"chonky_gurl\",\n    sex == \"Male\" & body_mass_g &lt;= quantile(body_mass_g, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE) ~ \"smol_boi\",\n    sex == \"Female\" & body_mass_g &lt;= quantile(body_mass_g, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE) ~ \"smol_gurl\",\n    TRUE ~ \"average\"\n  ))\n\n\nIn this code:\n\n\nWe use the case_when() function to define the conditions based on sex and body mass to categorize the penguins.\n\n\nFor males with a body mass greater than the 75th percentile, they are categorized as “chonky_boi.” For females with a body mass greater than the 75th percentile, they are categorized as “chonky_gurl.”\n\n\nFor males with a body mass less than or equal to the 25th percentile, they are categorized as “smol_boi.” For females with a body mass less than or equal to the 25th percentile, they are also categorized as “smol_gurl.”\n\n\nAll other penguins are categorized as “average.”\n\n\nWe then use mutate() to create the new variable “chonkiness” based on these conditions.\n\nI will spare you the full adventure (my chat history is here if you’d like to see) but after quite a bit of back-and-forth I realised that in the dataset “male” and “female” should both be lowercase and the code ChatGPT gave me had capitalised them both. There is no substitute for knowing your data.\nOnce I changed this, it worked.\n\n# Create a new variable based on conditions\npenguins &lt;- penguins %&gt;%\n  mutate(chonkiness = case_when(\n    sex == \"male\" & body_mass_g &gt; quantile(body_mass_g, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE) ~ \"chonky_boi\",\n    sex == \"female\" & body_mass_g &gt; quantile(body_mass_g, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE) ~ \"chonky_gurl\",\n    sex == \"male\" & body_mass_g &lt;= quantile(body_mass_g, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE) ~ \"smol_boi\",\n    sex == \"female\" & body_mass_g &lt;= quantile(body_mass_g, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE) ~ \"smol_gurl\",\n    TRUE ~ \"average\"\n  ))\n\nCopilot used a median split and didn’t try and create a third category, which is a questionable choice because the wording of the prompt really implies there needs to be something that the penguins are larger or smaller than. The code did work out of the box but remember the Jurassic Park rule: just because you can, doesn’t mean you should.\n\n# Assuming 'penguins' is your dataframe and 'body_mass_g' is the variable for body mass\n# First, we need to define what we consider 'large' and 'small'. \n# For this example, let's assume penguins heavier than the median are 'large', \n# and those equal or lighter are 'small'.\n\n# Calculate the median body mass\nmedian_body_mass &lt;- median(penguins$body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# Create the new variable 'size_category'\npenguins &lt;- penguins %&gt;%\n  mutate(size_category = case_when(\n    body_mass_g &gt; median_body_mass & sex == \"male\"   ~ \"chonky_boi\",\n    body_mass_g &gt; median_body_mass & sex == \"female\" ~ \"chonky_gurl\",\n    body_mass_g &lt;= median_body_mass & sex == \"male\"   ~ \"smol_boi\",\n    body_mass_g &lt;= median_body_mass & sex == \"female\" ~ \"smol_gurl\",\n    TRUE ~ NA_character_  # for missing or other values\n  ))\n\nThis code is a good example of why LLMs are inherently Luddites, even if they produce working code. When there’s missing data, case_when() used to require you to specify the type of NA, in this case NA_character. This is very uninintuitive, particularly when you’re trying to teach beginner coders (how can missing data have a type? is an entirely reasonable question) so I was delighted when it updated to remove this requirement. Additionally, TRUE was also changed to default which is a bit more readable.\nHowever, these changes are not reflected in Copilot’s code suggestion because the training data is older than the most recent update to case_when(). This example is relatively minor but it’s important to recognise that if you only use these kinds of AI to write code, you will very quickly be writing outdated code and using deprecated functions.\nGemini once again told me it could not complete my request and I have given up using it for the remainder of this chapter.",

    "text": "7.6 Conclusions and musings\nA large part of coding is looking up examples of code you’ve used before and then tweaking it to your new use case. If you use AI like this, then it can really help speed you up by giving you access to boiler plate code you can adapt. I also find it very useful for those functions that just refuse to stick in my brain - every time I try to change the labels on a faceted ggplot() I get it wrong. These days I just go straight to ChatGPT.\nAdditionally, if what you’re wanting to achieve is relatively simple - descriptive stats, basic plots, simple wrangling and cleaning - it can’t go that far wrong and it’s usually easy enough to spot when something is wrong.\nThese use cases work well because it’s your expertise that drives what the AI does and reviewing and tweaking the output is built-in to these workflows. These are the AI skills that everyone is going to need.\nBut using code written by an AI that you don’t understand is dangerous and irresponsible. Think of all the stupid errors it has made throughout this book, and then imagine someone using it to write code for their medical research. I dread to think of the impact that this abdication of responsibility and expertise is going to have (and will already be having).\nThis is a depressing way to end this book so I gave all three AIs the prompt:\n\nWrite me a fun piece of R code.\n\nChatGPT reassuring me comedy isn’t going to be outsourced any time soon:\n\n# Function to generate a random joke\ngenerate_joke &lt;- function() {\n  jokes &lt;- c(\n    \"Why don't scientists trust atoms?

Because he was outstanding in his field!\",\n    \"Why don't skeletons fight each other? They don't have the guts!\",\n    \"I'm reading a book on anti-gravity. It's impossible to put down!\"\n  )\n  return(sample(jokes, 1))\n}\n\n# Generate and print a random joke\ncat(\"Here's a random joke for you:\\n\")\n\nHere's a random joke for you:\n\ncat(generate_joke(), \"\\n\")\n\nI'm reading a book on anti-gravity.
